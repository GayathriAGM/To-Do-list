It’s designed with simplicity and usability in mind.
Showcases the power of JavaScript for dynamic DOM manipulation.
Provides a solid foundation for scaling into more complex applications like admin dashboards.
🔹 How It Can Be Used:
This tool can serve as a template for educational management systems or any app requiring CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
